# CS470

This is a final review for full stack development, with a breakdown of cloud-based infrastructure.

In this project roleplay, I have assumed the role of a developer at a startup tech company that has reached the point that they need to move their database infrastructure to a cloud-based option. This is due to growth that would lead to too much capital going to expanding their in-house servers, so Amazon Web Services has been chosen. This allows the tech firm to focus more of their time on creating a quality product for their consumer while also reducing the chances of doewntime due to server loads.
